# Tim-Sort

Timsort is a hybrid, stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. Tim sort is an adaptive sorting algorithm that needs O(n log n) comparisons to sort an array of n elements. It was designed and implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 in a python programming language. It has been python's standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3. It is one of the fastest sorting algorithm. The basic approach used in the Tim sort algorithm is - first divide the data into small chunks (preferably chunk sizes of 32 or 64) and solved these chunks by using the insertion sort and then merge all the big chunks using the merge function of the merge sort.
